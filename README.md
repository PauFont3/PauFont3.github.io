Hypermedia project. Part 1. Standard submission


Project Analysis:
This web page is designed with the aim of getting my personal CV to the company's human resources workers.
The HR employee will be able to navigate through the CV in a clear and simple way, first they will read a short summary based on how the company could take profit of
my technological and personal skills, after that the programming languages ​​that I'm familiar with are shown along with the languages ​​I can speak, this speeds up the work because in 
this way you can already start thinking about in which team I could start working with. The last part shows the professions in which I have worked, because
he/she can know in which areas I am familiar with. Once the revision of my CV is finished, if you are interested, you would scroll to the top of the website to find the
contact information and hire me.


Information Architecture:
The page is divided by 2 columns to distribute the content clearly and visually. 
On the upper part we have the header that contains the contact information with a short personal description and profile photo. This section is the first that is seen when the user enters the page. The header image tries to give a modern and technological effect to the webpage.
Below the header we find the main content of the web, this is also distributed using two columns. The left column includes the languages ​​of
programming that I'm familiar with and a list of work experience which is sorted from most recent to the oldest. While in the column on the right, there I have located the languages ​​I speak using a progress bar to show my level of the language visually, just below that we find the education received and under the education blog, it is shown some data that I consider relevant to be taken into account like the driver's license, to indicate that there would be no problem with in terms of being able to come to the office and being open to international work, as I think it can open many more doors to grown in my professional tech career.


Visual Design:
I have used dark colors in the design of the page to reduce visual fatigue, I have done this to avoid one of the reasons why the user leaves the page, which is due to the visual fatigue caused by the brightness of the screens on a white background, because as I can imagine there will be thousands of candidates and the human resoruce workers have to read all of them. My idea is that the only reason the user can leave my page is because they have already
finished reading all the information or maybe because the battery of their laptop battery has reach the 0%. I used the orange color to highlight key information such as the titles and the
my name, so that it's easier to locate them when we do an overview of the page.
I've used 'Segoe UI' as font because I think it's professional and clean, I've also chosen alternative fonts in case 'Segoe UI' it's not supported in some browsers or devices, some of them are 'Tahoma' or 'Verdana' which also give a professional style. I haven't used Arial because I think it's too common, because many texts uses this type of font by default and I want to stand out a little bit from the common styles.
I added a "hover" effect to give some interaction within the web, because I didn't want the whole web to be static knowing how user-interactive are websites are nowadays. I think it brings a small touch of modernity and allows the user not to lose sight of the element with which is focusing on.
Finally, I have chosen to use progress bars to show the level of speaking about a language, because it offers a very clear and easy to interpret which is my speaking level of that particular language, I have done it this way because I consider that putting high, medium or low is very relative, since a person can understand medium or low in one way, but
another person will consider it differently.
